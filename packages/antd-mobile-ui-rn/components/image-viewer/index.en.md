## ImageViewer.Multi

On the basis of `ImageViewer`, the following props have been added:

| Name          | Description                                 | Type                                          | Default |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| defaultIndex  | Which picture would be displayed by default | `number`                                      | `0`     |
| images        | Url list of image resources                 | `string[]`                                    | `[]`    |
| onIndexChange | Triggered when the picture is switched      | `(index: number) => void`                     | -       |
| renderFooter  | Render extra content on footer              | `(image: string, index: number) => ReactNode` | -       |

At the same time, the `image` prop is removed.

### Ref

| Name    | Description                   | Type                                          |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| swipeTo | Switch to the specified index | `(index: number, immediate: boolean) => void` |

## Imperative

Compared with the component-based usage above, the command-style is more convenient and more commonly used. In most cases, this method is recommended:

```ts | pure
const handler = ImageViewer.show(props)
const handlerMulti = ImageViewer.Multi.show(props)
```

You can directly enter the image view by calling the `show` method on the `ImageViewer`. The type of the `props` parameter is the same as the above table, but the `visible` prop is not supported. When the viewer is closed, the component instance would be automatically destroyed.

The return value of the `show` method is a component controller, which contains the following props:

| Name  | Description                       | Type         |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| close | Function to close the ImageViewer | `() => void` |

If you want to close all ImageViewers created by the `show` method. You can call `ImageViewer.clear()`.

## FAQ

### Why I updated the value of `defaultIndex`, but the image displayed by ImageViewer.Multi did not switch?

ImageViewer.Multi is an [uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#controlled-vs-uncontrolled-components) component, `defaultIndex` is only read once when the component is loaded, After this, if you change the value of `defaultIndex`, it will not have any effect on the component. Therefore, the following writing method does not have the effect of switching pictures:

```jsx
<Button
  onClick={() => {
    setIndex(i => i + 1)
  }}
>
  Next
</Button>
<ImageViewer.Multi
  images={images}
  defaultIndex={index}
  visible={visible}
  onClose={() => {
    setVisible(false);
  }}
/>
```

You can use ref for manual manipulation of ImageViewer.Multi, or consider using `ImageViewer.show()`.
